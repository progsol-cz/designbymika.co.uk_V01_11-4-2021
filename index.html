							<h1>Calories in Meat</h1>
							
<p>Meat consumption has been steadily increasing the past few
years. In fact, the <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=58312">USDA
Food Availability Data</a> shows an upward trend in per capita availability of
meat the past ten years. This is perhaps due to popular diets encouraging
people to shun carbohydrates in favor of protein. While there are plant-based
sources of protein, the most popular source remains to be meat from animals.
But just how healthy are these?</p><p>Let’s go over some of the most consumed types of meat to see
if they’re beneficial to our health. Find out as well how you can cook meat if
you are cutting down on calories.</p>

<h2>Types of Poultry</h2><p>Commonly referred to as <em>white meat</em>, poultry is the
most consumed meat in the US today. With consumers shifting to a healthier
diet, poultry has toppled beef in popularity due to its lower fat content.
However, not all types of poultry are low in fat. Let’s look at five of the
most consumed poultry meats.</p>

<h2>Types of Red Meat</h2><p>Meat from mammals is normally red when raw due to the
protein myoglobin. Hence, the term <em>red meat</em>. Even with the controversy surrounding
its effect on health, red meat is undoubtedly loaded with nutrients. It is a
great source of protein, iron, zinc, and selenium.</p>

<h2>Which Is the Healthiest Meat?</h2><p>There’s no single meat type that is healthier than all the
rest. The health benefits depend on many factors, including the environment
where the animals were raised and what they were fed. The nutrients also vary
depending on the cut of meat.</p><p>Its caloric content would also depend on which part it comes
from and how it is cooked. But to give you a general idea on how many calories
you’re likely to consume, here’s a comparison of the caloric content of
different types of meat based on a 100g serving.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src='images/INFOgrafika_calorie_1080x1080-1024x1022.jpg' class="lazyload wp-image-891"/></figure><h2>The Meat of the Matter</h2><p>Even with the controversies surrounding the ill effects of
meat consumption on our health and the environment, meat is still arguably a
good source of protein, iron, and other vitamins and minerals. It can still be
a part of a healthy diet as long as you make healthier choices about which type
of meat to eat and how to cook it.</p><p>Keep your consumption to around 70g per day and avoid
processed meat. If you’re cutting down on calories, choose low-fat modes of
cooking such as steaming, grilling, or roasting. You can also alternate meat
with plant-based sources of protein such as tofu, lentils, and hempseed. Most
importantly, balance your diet with ample amounts from other food groups,
especially fruits and vegetables.</p><p>Ultimately, good health relies on your overall diet and
lifestyle and not just on which type of meat you consume.</p>
